Welcome to BookStout!
Find a good book for a good bier!

Thank you for giving me an opportunity at BookShout!

App.js and Routes.js are in the /src directory.
All the components are inside /components inside the /src directory.

To view the React Project, unzip the files into a /bookstout directory

run yarn start

You should be good to go!

Yours,
Mark Berry
